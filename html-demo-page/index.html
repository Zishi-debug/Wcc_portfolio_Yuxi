            <h1>Mess them up</h1>
            <p>The creation process can be a complete struggle. Have you ever had a moment of confusion while creating? Have you ever had a moment when you wanted to tear the paper in your hand and run away from your failed ideas? My work is an attempt to turn chaos and confusion into a way of creation, and the computer will complete the creation for you. In this interactive installation, the anxiety in creation is simulated by repeatedly interacting with the creation space, meanwhile a unique piece of music and score are generated for you. I hope my audience can find inspiration in the random generation of both visual and audio stimulations of art.</p>
